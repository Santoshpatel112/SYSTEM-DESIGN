## 📚 The SOLID Principles

| # | Principle | Description | Status |
|---|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | **[SRP](./SRP)** | Single Responsibility Principle | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | **[OCP](./OCP)** | Open/Closed Principle | ✅ Complete |
| 3 | **[LSP](./LSP)** | Liskov Substitution Principle | ✅ Complete |
| 4 | **[ISP](./ISP)** | Interface Segregation Principle | ✅ Complete |
| 5 | **[DIP](./DIP)** | Dependency Inversion Principle | ✅ Complete |

## 🎯 Quick Overview

### 1️⃣ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
**One class, one job, one reason to change**

A class should have only one responsibility. If a class has multiple responsibilities, changes to one may affect the others.

[Learn SRP →](./SRP)

---

### 2️⃣ Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
**Open for extension, closed for modification**

You should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code. Use interfaces and polymorphism.

[Learn OCP →](./OCP)

---

### 3️⃣ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
**Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types**

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without breaking the application.

[Learn LSP →](./LSP)

---

### 4️⃣ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
**Many specific interfaces are better than one general interface**

No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. Create small, focused interfaces.

[Learn ISP →](./ISP)

---

### 5️⃣ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
**Depend on abstractions, not concretions**

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

## 🚀 Learning Path

```
Start → SRP → OCP → LSP → ISP → DIP → Master SOLID
```

1. Start with **SRP** - Learn to separate responsibilities
2. Move to **OCP** - Learn to extend without modifying
3. Understand **LSP** - Learn proper inheritance
4. Apply **ISP** - Learn to create focused interfaces
5. Master **DIP** - Learn to depend on abstractions

## 💡 Why SOLID?

✅ **Maintainable** - Easy to update and modify
✅ **Testable** - Simple to write unit tests
✅ **Flexible** - Adapt to changing requirements
✅ **Reusable** - Components can be used across projects
✅ **Scalable** - Grows without becoming messy
